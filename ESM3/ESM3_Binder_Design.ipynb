    "# ESM3\n",
    "ESM3 is a frontier generative model for biology, able to jointly reason across three fundamental biological properties of proteins: sequence, structure, and function. These three data modalities are represented as tracks of discrete tokens at the input and output of ESM3. You can present the model with a combination of partial inputs across the tracks, and ESM3 will provide output predictions for all the tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "ESM3 is a generative masked language model. You can prompt it with partial sequence, structure, and function keywords, and iteratively sample masked positions until all positions are unmasked. This iterative sampling is what the `.generate()` function does.\n",
    "\n",
    "![image.png](https://github.com/evolutionaryscale/esm/blob/main/_assets/esm3_diagram.png?raw=true)\n",
    "\n",
    "The ESM3 architecture is highly scalable due to its transformer backbone and all-to-all reasoning over discrete token sequences. At its largest scale, ESM3 was trained with 1.07e24 FLOPs on 2.78 billion proteins and 771 billion unique tokens, and has 98 billion parameters.\n",
    "Here we present `esm3-open-small`. With 1.4B parameters it is the smallest and fastest model in the family, trained specifically to be open sourced. ESM3-open is available under a non-commercial license."
