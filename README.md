# TEM-171 β-Lactamase Inhibitor Motif Generation Pipeline

## Abstract:
The global healthcare threat of antimicrobial resistance has commonly been attributed to the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria, particularly through β-lactamase-mediated antibiotic inactivation. A significant mechanism of β-lactam antibiotic resistance involves the hydrolyzation of the β-lactam ring, leading to a degradation of key antibiotics such as penicillins, cephalosporins, monobactams, and carbapenems. This research tackles this challenge by designing potent inhibitors specifically targeting TEM-171 β-lactamase (PDB ID 7QLP/7QOR, a critical resistance determinant. Creating an integrated pipeline combining cutting-edge AI/ML tools (AlphaFold2, ProteinMPNN, PyRosetta, RFDiffusion, BindCraft, etc.) for novel motif generation with rigorous in silico validation (molecular docking through AlphaFold3, GPU-accelerated molecular dynamics with OpenMM), I aim to identify and optimize highly specific competitive inhibitors capable of rapidly neutralizing TEM-171 activity. The successful development of such inhibitors holds immense potential to restore the efficacy of existing β-lactam antibiotics, reduce treatment failures, and ultimately curtail the morbidity and mortality associated with MDR bacterial infections.

## Pipeline:
This pipeline should serve as a guideline, visualization, and process description. The pipeline relies on several cutting-edge AL/ML tools for protein structure prediction, ligand generation, protein analysis, molecular dynamics & simulations, and more. Installation can be complex, so through this pipeline I provide an in-depth overview of all ML tool installations I utilized/produced, as well as results that followed.
