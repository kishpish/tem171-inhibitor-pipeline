# TEM-171 β-Lactamase Inhibitor/Competitive Binder Motif Generation Pipeline

The emergence of TEM-171 β-lactamase represents a critical threat to modern antimicrobial therapy due to its ability to hydrolyze an extended spectrum of β-lactam antibiotics. While traditional β-lactamase inhibitors like tazobactam show diminishing efficacy against this enzyme, no systematic approach exists for developing targeted protein-based inhibitors. Here, we present an integrated computational pipeline for de novo protein design targeting TEM-171, combining quantum-inspired diffusion models with evolutionary optimization. Our dual-platform approach employs RFDiffusion for scaffold generation (n=2048) and BindCraft for interface refinement (n=67), guided by AlphaFold2 structural predictions (mean pLDDT score: 93.2) and ProteinMPNN sequence optimization. The designed inhibitor demonstrates exceptional structural stability (RMSD: 1.2-1.5Å) and binding affinity (ΔG: -12.3 kcal/mol) in microsecond-scale molecular dynamics simulations, with force-displacement profiles revealing peak unbinding forces of 1500-1700 kN/mol. Notably, our optimal design exhibits a 2.8-fold improvement in binding affinity compared to tazobactam, achieving 45% inhibition at 100 µM concentration. The designed inhibitor maintains stable contacts with critical catalytic residues including Ser70 and maintains conformational integrity across varied physiological conditions (pH 6.5-8.0, 298-310K). Beyond the immediate therapeutic application, our generalizable framework demonstrates 38.4s average computation time per design and 94% success rate in generating stable protein-protein interfaces (i_ptm > 0.8), establishing a robust pipeline for accelerated therapeutic protein development. These findings not only present a promising candidate for combating TEM-171-mediated resistance but also provide a scalable methodology for addressing emerging therapeutic challenges through rational protein design.

## Pipeline:
This pipeline should serve as a guideline, visualization, and process description. The pipeline relies on several cutting-edge AL/ML tools for protein structure prediction, binder generation, protein analysis, molecular dynamics, docking & simulations, and more. Installation can be complex, so through this pipeline I provide an in-depth overview of all ML tool installations I utilized/produced, as well as results that followed.
